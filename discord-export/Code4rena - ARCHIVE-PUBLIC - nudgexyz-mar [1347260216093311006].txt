How much `rewardPPQ` we can expect @Raph


[03/18/2025 03:30] mosharaf
No QA rewards !!
If no HMs are found , how the rewards will be distributed ??
Or , will there be any reward in that case ?? 

Previously , we've seen whole pot getting distributed based on QAs in this particular case in C4.

@Raph The "Scoping Q & A" section of the README says "Any (all possible ERC20s)" are supported, where as the official documentation says:

"Nudge does not support non-standard ERC20 tokens (fee-on-transfer, rebasing tokens…) and ERC20 tokens with a value returned by decimals( ) that is inaccurate or strictly above 18." (https://docs.nudge.xyz/technical-documentation/smart-contracts)

Am I missing something?

Take realistic APR values, then you can deduce what we call ROI: If the APR is for a year, the ROI is for the duration of the holding period (we will launch with 1 week by default).
Then rewardPPQ is `(target token price in USD * ROI * PPQ_DENOMINATOR) / (reward token price in USD)`

[03/18/2025 16:57] riceee8969
>  However, because this isn't just a "simple" swap, Nudge also encodes in the transaction a contract call for Li.fi's smart contracts to execute after the tokens are swapped.

Could someone clarify the control flow after a swap is completed via Li.fi's SDK? Specifically, which smart contract(s) are being interacted with again to call the `handleReallocation` function? Based on my understanding of the SDK documentation, there doesn’t seem to be a function that accepts an encoded contract call for Li.fi's smart contracts to execute. I'd appreciate any insights on how this process works!

@Raph @SensoYard Hello guys, can you give more info about Reallocation Flow and how things works with LI.FI Integration, thanks!


[03/18/2025 17:33] raphaelroullet (pinned)
I see there's quite a few questions around the whole flow and integration with Li.fi.

I will update our docs but note that we are using the following:
- from their SDK: https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#request-contract-call-quote
- which I believe is a wrapper for this API endpoint: https://docs.li.fi/li.fi-api/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote/cross-chain-contract-calls

If you want to get a better understanding of the whole flow onchain for a reallocation swap and how `handleReallocation` is called, I think it's helpful to inspect the following transaction that we have included in the README:

https://basescan.org/tx/0xe11e8013db2118413b91e9281dd253ab0cb4dcb3782567262ab362aebdb7d033

I will try to provide an example of a transaction for a cross-chain reallocation as well.

Thanks for the quick response. Another question that might be useful, but I don't think is covered is how trusted are campaign creators? I am not talking about the assigned admin, but the creator itself, if he can use a set of parameters that can help him steal funds from his users, would that be valid or would it be deemed a user mistake for using a malicious campaign?

Sorry this might be similar to previous questions, but we have documentation on ERC20 behaviors in/out of scope however the campaign creation is permissionless so any sort of tokens can be used. Although there is nothing to stop a Campaign being created using out of scope tokens, do we need to just ignore this scenario?

Yes, the system appears to be a very closed (complete) loop that does nothing edgy/permissionless to cause problems.


[03/19/2025 09:30] riceee8969
Well Im not sure about this one, but I asked something a bit similar to this, regarding the campaign admins (about how they can withdraw the available rewards anytime they want unexpectedly), but the reply was

> Hello! With that definition then yes they can be considered trusted. It's their campaign they're running so if they want to withdraw all rewards they should communicate beforehand, deactivate then withdraw as you said otherwise they might disappoint some users, but ultimately that's up to them and out of scope from a protocol perspective.


[03/19/2025 09:31] riceee8969
I think possible, because they are using Li.Fi for their swaps, Im not certain tho


[03/19/2025 09:38] luc1jan
I don't see problem with this. Because they can withdraw only unallocated rewards. This would have no impact on anyone

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/19/2025 09:44] riceee8969
Well the impact here isnt a high or med but this would be unexpected DoS for the users, if a campaign admin has the power to withdraw their rewards anytime they want to without deactivating the campaign prior to the withdrawal. Or if we think more then maybe grieving the protocol by repeatedly doing this, since theres no incentive required to deploy a campaign


[03/19/2025 09:49] riceee8969

I see what you mean, but users see unallocated rewards of each campaign, they won't try to participate because it's clear there is no rewards available. UI would rank campaigns based on rewards and APR and probably hide ones with no rewards (I assume)

Hi @Raph , @SensoYard. Concerning the `invalidateParticipations` method.
Is the nudge operator an automated system or is it a human being?

Asking more so to know if there is a grace period between when a campaign participation is marked for invalidation and when it effectively gets invalidated and if the recipient of said participation has any recourse to reverse the decision of invalidating his participation right at the instant T before his participation gets invalidated.

If a protocol wants to stop a campaign,  we would recommend to them the following action plan:
1. We would communicate in advance that the campaign is about to be stopped in X days (they could communicate to)
2. Then we would call `setIsCampaignActive()` to deactivate the campaign and prevent any new participation
3. Protocol withdraw rewards (if there are any left in the campaign contract)

@Raph I wanted to understand which chains it would be deployed on. Is it just Ethereum?
Or will factory and nudge campaign be deployed on other evm chains?

I suppose the readme means that the base chain for **now** will stay ethereum but re-allocations to other chains is possible (means the positions on other chains will be monitored  as well by the nudge team)

Hi!
For launch we'll have:
Single chain realloc on Eth mainnet
Single chain realloc on one of the L2s mentioned
Cross chain realloc from mainnet to one of the L2s listed

I had asked it in a PT earlier because the wording confused me too

@Raph Can you check my Pt please?


[03/21/2025 11:07] punisher1303
Yeah, here is a quick overview of `toAmount` variable input,
the `toAmount` variable is the NUMBER OF TOKENS that will be used to determine the REWARD AMOUNT. 

for example, suppose `toAmount` = 100, which means you're calculating the reward for someone who has 100 of the "target tokens".


[03/21/2025 11:09] punisher1303
Just want to ask, in `NudgeCampaign.sol` is feeBps user-input based variable? I mean it can be set by the user or it have to be a CONSTANT VALUE or something?

1. We expect the majority of native token reallocation to happen in scenarii of cross chain reallocations correct?

2. We expect the majority of ERC20 token reallocations to happen within the same chain. correct?

3. to a lesser extent, we expect cross chain ERC20 to ERC20 reallocations, correct?

It's basically a database on a blockchain, not an app. The only problem here is that there are many ways for trusted roles to abuse the system, although in C4 this is always considered a low-severity issue.

How high would impact have to be if trusted roles in this protocol are literally allowed to invalidate any participant and take all the rewards.


[03/24/2025 08:38] pfapostol
There is no impact higher than this, and this is normal protocol behavior

[03/24/2025 08:40] heliosophistxiv
Yeah you could argue that impact is high (e.g. admin can steal all funds) and with likelihood low it would indeed be medium. Problem is that we're classifying bugs in a discrete manner (L/M/H) but in reality it's more granular. E.g. low likehood could be that any user can exploit something once a month when a timestamp is a specific value - but that happens once a month, while compromising the private key of an admin (or an admin turning malicious) is something much harder to measure as it depends on individual OPSEC etc. If there's a single admin key and the dev team is guarding that as if their life depended on it, then it would happen much less frequently than once a month. From a practical standpoint accepting admin issues would just flood every contest with useless items such as "dev dies, protocol funds stuck forever"

They’d need to cooperate with the campaign admin to do so.

Adding this to my report so it is chosen for report


[03/24/2025 08:43] dulgiq
yes, it is considered trusted


[03/24/2025 08:44] nbody
so any loss of funds linked to something executed by this user is considered low, as per what the other gentlemen here are saying?


[03/24/2025 08:45] pfapostol
Li.fi is used to simplify multicall transactions, you could check the transactions example, provided in README


[03/24/2025 08:45] 10ap17
## All trusted roles in the protocol

We are using role-based access control in the protocol. Below are the roles that can be found, and how they will be assigned initially:


| SWAP_CALLER_ROLE | This role is initially given to one of Li.fi’s contracts (called Executor).|


[03/24/2025 08:47] nbody
thanks for clarifying that, I did understand that part thanks to @0xfirefist . My question is more related to what severity to assign to my findings.


[03/24/2025 08:48] heliosophistxiv
tell me what you found and I'll assign a severity

[03/24/2025 08:48] heliosophistxiv
it's hard to tell without knowing exactly what happens but most contest platforms have guidelines in their docs


[03/24/2025 08:50] nbody
I was just confused by the statement that, anything originating from a `trusted` role is immediately considered low. Where in this contract, thats essentially everything. Eitherway, I am very curious to see what other people have found. Definitely a fun first contest for me


[03/24/2025 08:51] heliosophistxiv
overall I evalute these:
- likelihood: who can execute/initiate the attack? what prerequisites are there? e.g. anyone can attack without any prereq: high, anyone can execute attack but only when X and Y happens before (and they are realistic): medium
- impact: mostly DoS or loss of funds: does the protocol lose fees, locked funds, etc? is it only a few %? do users lose money? if a single user loses complete deposit that's high imo, or many users lose a few %


[03/24/2025 08:52] pfapostol
not anything, only mistakes and abuses, if you found a logical error or a broken invariant in the admin function it will be a valid finding


[03/24/2025 08:52] heliosophistxiv
try to imagine you're the dev team and assess the headache you feel when your attack happens

I think he meant that sometimes you think that the bug you found is a Low, but other users Sees a way to break/harm the protocol through it making it a High or Med

Yeah if it's submitted as a low it can't be upgraded to H/M 
It's written on the contest page, almost every


[03/25/2025 05:27] pfapostol
Yes, this doesn't look like a problem in this contest, since many people simply submitted the low/non-critical issues as high, even skipping the medium severity.

Triage = evaluation by the validator, so this means that the validator believed your submissions were of insufficient quality, or contained insufficient evidence of validity.


[03/31/2025 15:38] daniel526
@CloudEllie what happens in this scenario?
the issue i discussed with the sponsers and they mentioned "This is by design, the balance of the swap caller (lifi's contract) is entirely for the user and the result of whatever swap was performed" hence i didn't submit the finding but i am seeing a finding related to this marked "sufficient"

In coding terms, it's like this,

```


[04/01/2025 11:17] mrfalsegenius
Check the comment from validator


[04/01/2025 11:17] mrfalsegenius
They must've provided a comment on why that tag was assigned to it


[04/01/2025 11:21] mrfalsegenius
If your finding is marked `sufficient`, it goes into something called `findingsRepo`. 

From the docs:
`The judge reviews all submissions in the findings repo.`


[04/01/2025 11:26] darvex2077
in this case it is marked invalid and  sufficient but then it is crossed  
yes there is a comment below... i just want to know it will still be pushed to the findings repo, since the sufficient tag was crossed..

If the sufficient tag is crossed, it's not sufficient. That means, it's `insufficient`

Im guessing validator said “Role  is trusted”


[04/01/2025 11:44] darvex2077
yeah.. 
 but i think  the validator surly got this wrong this time....
as the function is public and can be called by anyone , not just " users with role"


[04/01/2025 11:46] cd_pandora
When a campaign is deployed, a role will be assigned to the creator “Campaign_Admin” which is under trusted roles


[04/01/2025 11:52] darvex2077
yes but the point of my submission was on rewardPPQ as  "deploy campaign " is callable by anyone and lacks a zero check on rewardPPQ...  
 but the Validator probly feels it  "deploy campaign"  is only callable by some admin


[04/01/2025 11:56] mrfalsegenius
"Since campaign deployment is permissionless, we can't fully trust any campaign deployed. For that reason we'll have a whitelist on Nudge.xyz and display appropriate warnings to users for campaigns we haven't vetted. ~ `Raph`"


[04/01/2025 11:59] mrfalsegenius
Campaign info will probably be displayed on Nudge.xyz even if someone directly interacts with protocol and creates a campaign. Maybe that's why your report was invalidated


[04/01/2025 12:02] darvex2077
if targetToken and rewards Token are really being checked , then that "rewardPPQ"   also should.. cos  i think is causes a real treat to the protocol
Protocol should be doing every thing possible to ensure the have less threath to their functionality


[04/01/2025 12:16] mrfalsegenius
Yes, something like that, but a campaign is all about reallocating to the target asset for incentives which means it's only natural that users would want to check how much they're getting for letting go of their tokens for a tokenX. So naturally, they would look into `rewardPPQ`.


[04/01/2025 12:27] luc1jan
PPQ is visible on UI so it makes no threat to protocol, users simply won’t deposit to 0 PPQ

[04/02/2025 03:08] 4mj3x
i don't think the original report showcases the full impact and that's why the sponsor disputed it, it's about tricking the campaign into rewarding the user multiple times for the same reallocation


[04/02/2025 07:16] tusharr1411
Don't you think he still needs to hold that much amount to be able to claim the reward...? Participation struct for user participation store the `amountReceived` from the  lifi Executor , not the swap amount `toAmount` . And same for the `NewParticipation` event emission, it is emitted with `amountReceived` as toAmount. So doesn't matter how much he originally swapped he still need to hold  `amountReceived` amount of targetToken to be able to claim rewards.If he moves the funds, he will be invalidated, and his locked reward will be made available in the pool for further participants


[04/02/2025 07:31] 4mj3x
the attack i thought of is to inflate the reward as follows:
```
- Attacker got 200 eth and 0 stEth, he swaps 100 eth to 100 stEth.
- Now he has 100 stEth, and 100 eth.
- The next 100 eth, he doesn't swap it directly, he swaps it one eth by one eth and each time he performs this attack :
    1 - Attacker swaps just 1 eth, and sends the 100 stEth directly (which gets transferred back in the same transaction), so he got the reward for swapping 101 eth by just swapping one and keeping the rest 99.
    2 - Attacker sends 1 eth again, the attacker gets the reward for 101 eth, but he still got 98.... and so on
```
so basically he can get the reward for swapping without actually swapping


[04/02/2025 07:33] 4mj3x
that's the issue, the `amountReceived` is calculated based on `balanceOf(msg.sender)`, so if you send tokens which you gained from a previous participation to the swap caller, you will inflate the balance and therefore inflate the reward, which basically means you tricked the campaign into rewarding you two times for that first reallocation


[04/02/2025 07:34] 4mj3x
( the tokens you transferred will be transferred back immediately )

[04/02/2025 07:43] tusharr1411
after the first iteration of attack he need to hold 101 stETH to be able to claim the reward for that 101stETH. Because when he swapped 1 ETH to 1stETH and send another 100stETH to lifi swap executor contract directly ,campaign contract does not change the state of campaign contract based on `toAmount` which is 1stETH, but is getting changed based on the `amountReceived` (101stETH). 
Nudge backend will keep track of user participation based on Participation struct or NewParticipation event emission. And both these are using `amountReceived` as to Amount. So he need to hold `amountReceived` (101stETH) to be able to claim reward.


[04/02/2025 07:43] tusharr1411
correct me if I'm wrong...


[04/02/2025 07:47] 4mj3x
no the contract will see it as 101 stEth, and that's what the user will be holding because the tokens will be transferred immediately back to him in line 206, so the invalidation condition aren't met.


[04/02/2025 07:50] 4mj3x
the arg `toAmount` is just used to check slippage in line 202, so the fact that he only swapped 1 ETH ( toAmount ) will not affect anything, and he'll still get the reward as if he swapped 101 eth


[04/02/2025 07:51] tusharr1411
Then how much he need to hold ?


[04/02/2025 08:08] mrfalsegenius
@tusharr1411 

Here's the crux of it.
1. Campaign pulls entire balance from Executor.
2. Campaign calculates rewards based on this balance.
3. Campaign sends it or rather returns it back to user if they donated it to executor.

Let's say I hold 5 target tokens and swap 1 token. All I need to do to get the juicy rewards is donate 5 targetTokens to executor and swap one under the same transaction. Then, I'll get rewards based on 6 target tokens even though I only swapped one.

At the end of the day, I get my tokens back and I am eligible for rewards.

It's a good one!


[04/02/2025 08:09] tusharr1411
the thing is then you need to hold 6 tokens to be able to claim that juicy rewards


[04/02/2025 08:10] mrfalsegenius
Yes, once you hold 6, it starts!


[04/02/2025 08:10] mrfalsegenius

@FalseGenius , I've got a quick question.
Under what conditions do we expect the nudge operator to call the `invalidateParticipations` method?

@0xspryon  When they're going for garbage activity like this


[04/02/2025 08:12] mrfalsegenius
Then they'd get blacklisted lol


[04/02/2025 08:12] 0xspryon
Except if I missed it, there isn't a blacklist functionality in the app but I get your point.


[04/02/2025 08:13] 0xspryon
So, does the `invalidateParticipations` method mitigate the risk brought about by this issue?


[04/02/2025 08:16] mrfalsegenius
It's more like, if the team is aware of this issue, they could invalidate attacker. If they aren't aware, then attacker could do whatever they want.
The risk stays. The real question is this,
`Under what conditions does the protocol invalidate/penalize a user? The protocol didn't exactly state that.`

Is the `invalidateParticipations` in place to handle scenarios like the one we're discussing?


[04/02/2025 08:17] 0xspryon
Re: Is the invalidateParticipations in place to handle scenarios like the one we're discussing? 

My logic tells me yes. Which also means that, the protocol is well aware of the issue.


[04/02/2025 08:17] mrfalsegenius
The sponsor is prolly going for this kind of dispute


[04/02/2025 08:18] tusharr1411

The sponsor could just say, "Hey, we have that invalidate participation function in place for such activities since we actively monitor what's happening outside the protocol" and that would invalidate the issue


[04/02/2025 08:19] mrfalsegenius
The auditor could say, "Hey, you just learned about it."


[04/02/2025 08:19] mrfalsegenius

[04/02/2025 08:20] mrfalsegenius
100%


[04/02/2025 08:20] mrfalsegenius
But this system is in place ONLY for the holding period


[04/02/2025 08:21] mrfalsegenius
whatever transfers happen after that would be skipped by protocol lol


[04/02/2025 08:21] mrfalsegenius
So there's that


[04/02/2025 08:23] mrfalsegenius
making the vuln....VALID. This is actually outside scope of those nudge system bots actively tracking everything. They're there for duration of holding period. Once the holding period is over, attacker can go all out on the protocol, bypassing everything. The monitoring starts once participation starts. 

This donation attack happens before that!

Invalidating this finding seems off to me because if a participant knows their id they can claim reward directly in the smart contract of the campaign. This is my first contest I don't know if there would be time to dispute and complain about the judgement

Backend validation only works when someone accesses through the front end it does not work on the smart contract


[04/02/2025 08:31] 4mj3x
Exactly, once the attacker gets their reward for their first participation, the status is now CLAIMED, so they can use those tokens to exploit this vuln and inflate the reward, and the participation wont be invalidated

[04/02/2025 08:31] tusharr1411
is it in docs or somewhere else ...?


[04/02/2025 08:34] sulaimon3546
I could not find the backend validation in the docs. My issue is that even if there's backend validation nothing stops an attacker from claiming reward of already sold reallocated assets on the smart contract direct since there's no validation  in the contract


[04/02/2025 08:35] tusharr1411
each participation will have different pID. So the next participation doen't depends on the status of  prev. participation of that user.

[04/02/2025 08:41] sulaimon3546
While this could work but still someone can still reallocate a single token multiple times and one of them could be missed by the relayer.  The best option would still be having validation on the smart contract that safe guard


[04/02/2025 08:42] sulaimon3546
The best practice is actually putting safety measures in the smart contract directly.

[04/02/2025 10:18] cloudellie
It's expected that there may be some errors during the triage phase. Judging has not started for this audit, but once it does, the judge will review all of the submissions and make their own assessment of the duplicate groupings.


[04/02/2025 10:43] 0xslowbug
Okay 

This gives me hope and hopefully there’s no validators bias in it too. Had to refrain from speaking about a finding cos I don’t understand the Good Citizen Rule so I don’t get caught in it. 

Once I get SR status I’m getting a law degree😂

When learning I wasn’t told that the best of auditors are the best at winning arguments.

I think I should also appeal my findings because the sponsors reviews don’t make sense to me. I’ll note down my case facts 😉


[04/02/2025 14:51] 0xslowbug
Only SR can appeal unless you’re one

If I can appeal I would have appealed. 

Oh @CloudEllie help ask the board to consider letting auditors be able to add comment atleast just once before judging starts proper. Only SR can still escalate after judging.

This would greatly help


[04/02/2025 15:08] pfapostol
The amount of spam related to findings discussion in this chat over the last two days, even before judging started, is probably a good argument against PJQA being open to everyone. Most people just don't understand the process, the impact, and the validity. 

And that's not a bad thing, everyone starts somewhere, but if you make a single judge to explain all these misunderstandings, the process will become even longer than it already is.

What if the issue will be validated now?

Can anyone explain why this is invalid? The idea is, you get rewards according to the amount you reallocated to. Users can get more rewards than the swapped amount because of existence of these lines here,
```
    uint256 balanceOfSender = tokenReceived.balanceOf(msg.sender); <---!
     ...

With all due respect, I would like to say that this report is a Medium not a High https://code4rena.com/evaluate/2025-03-nudgexyz/submissions/F-14 as there is no loss of rewards or tokens for the users, only a partial Dos. Other reports on this contest that reported a reward loss or a target token loss were marked as medium, so based on that, this F-14 reports cannot be marked as high if there is no loss to users.

The issue outlines how the entire protocol can be DoS-ed for prolonged times, so why is it not a High? The attacker can execute the transaction an arbitrary number of times without any cost, thus disabling the main function of the whole protocol.

Hello, I want to comment on this here in the chat because, unlike other platforms, I see that C4 doesn't allow me to comment directly on the report:

I see that all my previously confirmed reports have been invalidated. A couple of my reports were invalidated with a comment like this below, which basically says it's invalid because the cause originates externally to the scoped contracts.

{Attachments}
Code4rena - ARCHIVE-PUBLIC - nudgexyz-mar [1347260216093311006].txt_Files/image-A330A.png


[04/09/2025 15:55] mike_bello90
But as is well known, bugs typically originate from the interactions that scoped contracts have with other systems, this has been accepted in virtually all previous and current contests. Additionally, what I reported affects users and scoped contracts, causing a DOS and loss of rewards, which had already been accepted in the previous stages of this contest.
If the fact that the bug does not originate or start in a scope contract but in an external element that interacts with the scope contracts is a valid way to invalidate a report, then the two accepted reports would also be invalid because both depend on or originate from the li.fi executor contract, which is not part of the scope but does interact with the scope contracts. However, these reports were accepted as valid, therefore, it is incorrect that other reports originating from the interactions of scope contracts with other elements are invalidated even when the scope contracts and protocol users are affected by these bugs. In this case, the correct approach would be to apply the same validation/invalidation rule to all contest reports,  and not only to some reports.


[04/09/2025 15:55] mike_bello90
Specifically, this report is about a bug in cross-chain reallocations and what the comment is basically saying is the way cross-chain reallocations work in nudge, so based on the rules stated on the contest page, cross-chain reallocations are in scope, so the way nudge handles these cross-chain reallocations is in scope as well.

[04/14/2025 04:22] mrfalsegenius
It's because your report and the PoC zooms in on using tokens with 0 decimals which the protocol would never add. Yes, `< 6 decimals` is in scope, but the admin would only add tokens with actual decimals (`> 0`). Maybe you should've confirmed that. 

The protocol wanted you to find an issue where, when they add a low-decimal token i.e., 2 decimals, it would result in code bugging out or giving 0 rewards etc...

The `0 rewards because of a 0 decimal token` is like the universal truth. 

The judge probably asked the team,
`Hey, which low-decimal ERC20s are we dealing with here?` 

Team:
`Anything < 6. So for example, we could go with something that has 2~3 decimals i.e., GUSD`.

Judge:
`What about 0 decimals?`

Team:
`Nah`

Judge:
`Cool`

The system assumes that only trusted administrators can change these parameters. The comment  “ @sorryNotsorry / admins are trusted” implies that this design choice is based on trust.

Relying on trust alone can be risky. For example, if an admin account gets hacked or if an admin makes a mistake, the fee could be set too Zero, potentially hurting the protocol or benefiting someone in an unfair way.

The issue says that POTENTIALLY a token used could have 0 decimals, the readme only accepts < 6 decimals tokens in scope, which includes 0 decimal tokens; it does not exclude 0 decimal tokens from scope. 0 decimals token is the example used to show the impact in the PoC, but the same root cause and similar impact would be valid for 2-3 token decimals, is this correct @sorryNotsorry ?

Hi,

I stepped out from Judging due to family reasons. But since this contest is in PJQA, it means the new judge already evaluated your issue.

[04/14/2025 13:18] elser17
Where can I see his comments about the issue? About escalations on issues, are they done typically in the contest channel (like this) or is there a method to do it on C4?


[04/14/2025 13:21] thebrittfactor
Judge comments will be included at the bottom of the issue in-app, if provided. Regarding escalations, only SR wardens are able to participate in PJ QA. Their comments are also added in-app.

[04/14/2025 13:22] elser17
Thx, how long is the period for escalations? Is there any announcement when it starts?


[04/14/2025 13:23] elser17
Just to know whether I can still escalate


[04/14/2025 13:24] thebrittfactor
PJ QA is open for 48 hours and has since closed for this audit. The judge may opt to re-open comments pending their review of the received issues. However, it doesn't look like you have the [SR role](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors/sr-backstage-wardens), so you'll be unable to participate in escalations.

@MrPotatoMagic 

 S-700 – Not a Unique Finding, Should Be Duplicated to F-8
Let’s start with the frontrunning aspect.

The protocol is expected to be deployed on both mainnet and L2 chains. However, frontrunning on L2s is significantly harder due to differences in how transactions are sequenced and how mempools operate — in most cases, frontrunning is simply not viable.

Even on Ethereum mainnet, the proposed attack is highly impractical. An attacker would need to:

Take out a flashloan,

Initiate a swap with a higher gas fee to frontrun a legitimate user,

And ultimately just cause that user’s transaction to revert.

The result? A denial-of-service (DoS) against one user, with no financial gain to the attacker. It’s a griefing attack at best — expensive, ineffective, and ultimately pointless. There's no incentive for anyone to attempt this in practice.

Now, let’s consider a scenario without a flashloan — where an attacker simply frontruns to claim rewards before someone else. That’s not an issue either. It’s expected behavior. Once the reward pool is drained, any further participation will rightly revert. That’s part of how the system is designed to work.

On the other hand, if a flashloan is used to temporarily boost participation and manipulate rewards:

The loan must be repaid in the same transaction.

That causes the attacker’s participation to become invalid.

Any claimed rewards would be refunded.

So again, there’s no real benefit — just unnecessary gas costs.

But the more important point is this:

All of the core impact — especially the risk of permanent campaign DoS — is already covered in F-8 and S-790 since if repeatedly pulled of the protocol consumes the whole fees since they are not getting refunded

[04/14/2025 17:10] kann_p
The idea that the campaign can be permanently disabled through repeated participation attempts (whether frontrun, flashloaned, or not) has already been accepted and documented. S-700 does not introduce a new vector; it simply describes a specific variation of an already known and accepted problem.

As such, S-700 should be marked as a duplicate of F-8 , as it does not demonstrate a distinct vulnerability or meaningful new risk.


[04/14/2025 17:29] mrpotatomagic
Please note that findings should not be discussed publicly before the report is published. Both @sorryNotsorry and I have provided our reasoning in the comments with sufficient proof for all issues.

[04/14/2025 18:08] kann_p
Just to add a final note regarding the decision by the judge on S-700:

First bullet point from the judge comment on escalation admits that this issue shares a fragment of the same root cause as F-8 

Second bullet point literally acknowledges that the impact is exactly the same — which reinforces the argument that this is not a unique finding.

Third bullet point says that solving the primary issue doesn’t fix the issue here. That might be true in a theoretical sense, but as I previously wrote: you cannot prevent frontrunning, but pulling this off in L1 by wasting an enormous amount of gas just to frontrun and DOS a single user doesn't make sense. It’s not worth it. In L2, we already know this can’t realistically be pulled off at all.

Basically the only thing that is being added to this "unique report" is the frontrunning part

Sorry to any wardens reading this — I'm trying to word this carefully to avoid revealing or discussing anything unnecessary from the reports, especially since I’ve been warned once before.

That said, I think the judge should really reconsider the result here. For me, this is my final message for this report. 🫡


[04/14/2025 18:42] cd_pandora
I think auditors deserve the right to drop comments on their findings on the C4 platform tho regardless of the SR role


[04/14/2025 18:43] kann_p
Incorrect you have not understand the situation at all. It should remain medium but as a duplicate of F-8 as I mentioned.


[04/14/2025 19:14] welith
@MrPotatoMagic hello sir… sorry for tagging you, but do you plan to open comments for the newly appeared unique, so that SRs can comment and gather some info on how the issue could be scaled to affect more than one user per execution? thx in advance!


[04/14/2025 19:41] mrpotatomagic
Unfortunately no, I've updated the primary issue to answer that. I believe the respective wardens have provided more than enough proof for the issue at hand.


[04/14/2025 21:43] cd_pandora
https://code4rena.com/evaluate/2025-03-nudgexyz/submissions/S-212 I actually believe this should be a medium issue as participants will lose funds

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 @MrPotatoMagic 
Just wanted to get some clarity on severity classification as per C4 rules.

Even if a vulnerability can be repeatedly carried out DoSing the protocol continuously, is it a Medium severity? (No preconditions required)

I should mention that no "direct fund loss" happens but then again no user is able to use the protocol, so not sure if that's considered a fund loss or not?

P.S.: does profitability of the attack in such a case bear any impact on severity?

I am asking with S-700 in mind (not mentioning any details about the issue as I understand that's not allowed), since I thought it would be `High` and not a `Med`.


[04/15/2025 06:06] loptuskr
this issue could be med or high?


[04/15/2025 06:44] derastephh
Report not out yet?


[04/15/2025 08:26] cloudellie
I would suggest asking this in the #❓・questions channel and asking some judges to weigh in, as it's a nuanced question and pertains to C4 severity definitions more broadly than this specific audit.

[04/15/2025 08:31] werulez99
This issue is DoSing only a single user , but the F-14 is DoSing the whole protocol becomes unusable and it's Med lol , so yeah ...Even thought the protocol insolvency is clear 💀
